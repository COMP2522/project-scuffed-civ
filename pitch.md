**One-liner:**  
Scuffed-Civ is a top down tile-based turn-based strategy game.  
  
**Outline:**  
Scuffed-Civ is a top down strategy game. The "map" will be randomly generated as a variable set of  
tiles which be set on the creation of a new game and displayed and updated live on-screen via Processing.org.  
The game will demonstrate non-blocking concurrent/asynchronous processing through a server. The game will also  
demonstrate persistant data state's with a saveable game state so the game can be re-opened and resumed at a  
later time. Scuffed-Civ will have two Entity types, 'Buildings' and 'Units' which are buildings and movable units. 
These can be customized upon creation to allow for a more customized and strategic gameplay experience.  
These units and buildings will be kept track of by the game and server as the game runs.  
We will consistently update documentation and write comments for our code to ensure documentation is existent and  
maintainable.
  
**Communication Policies:**  
We will meet each Monday after our second class for at least 30 minutes to discuss how our respective aspects are  
going. We will also continuously use Discord to stay up to date. For issues where no decision is able to be reached  
we will solve with a majority consensus vote.
